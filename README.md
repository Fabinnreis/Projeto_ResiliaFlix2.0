# TURBOFLIX

The main goal of this project is to provide information about movies through the OMDB API. 

## STRUCTURE

The project is divided in 4 different files:

***css:*** All the stylesheets are contained in this file(.css).
***htmls:*** Here you will find the .html archives of the website(except for the index.html which is one level higher).
***imgs:*** In this file are the images displayed in the project.
***srcs:*** Last but not least, you can find here all the coding, which is dismmembered in: Controllers, Helpers, Models and Views.

PS: index.html is located at the main file to make its access easier, .gitignore holds the google API key.

Subfiles(srcs):

***Helpers:*** Helpers are auxiliary codes. Usually, they're holding important variables or functions to the proper behavior of the system.

***Models:*** As their name indicate, they're a model which is used to save the information obtained through the APIs.

***Views:*** Views organize the information acquired from the APIS in a section.

***Controllers:*** The controller file manipulates all data needed to make a request for the APIs and organizes the information avaiable in the screen to the user. It makes the model avaiable through the view.
