# TURBOFLIX

The main goal of this project is to provide information about movies through the OMDB API. 

## Structure

The project is divided in 5 different files:

**css:** All the stylesheets are contained in this file(.css).
**htmls:** Here you will find the .html archives of the website(except for the index.html which is one level higher).
**imgs:** In this file are the images displayed in the project.
**srcs:** Last but not least, you can find here all the coding, which is dismmembered in: Controllers, Helpers, Models and Views.

Subfiles(srcs):

**Controllers:** The controller file manipulates all data needed to make a request for the APIs and organizes the information avaiable in the screen to the user.

**Helpers:** Helpers are auxiliary codes. Usually, they're holding important variables or functions to the proper behavior of the system.

**Models:** As their name indicate, they're a model which is used to save the information obtained through the APIs.

**Views:** Views organize the information acquired from the APIS in a section.
